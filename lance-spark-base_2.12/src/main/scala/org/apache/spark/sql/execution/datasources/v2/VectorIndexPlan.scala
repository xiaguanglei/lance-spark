/**
 * Fully resolved, validated vector index parameters.
 *
 * Plain Scala case classes — Serializable by virtue of `Product with Serializable`.
 * Holds only primitive types, Option, and the IndexType enum (Java enums are
 * Serializable). Does NOT hold lance-core BuildParams classes, because those are
 * not guaranteed Serializable and we want clean task closures.
 *
 * Stores the Java [[DistanceType]] enum directly so driver and executor code do
 * not need to round-trip through hand-maintained canonical string names.
